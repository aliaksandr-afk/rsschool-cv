## Summary

Web development is my calling. The place where I found myself. I am moving in this direction and
want to become a senior web-developer. I like to learn new technologies, solve unusual problems and self-develop.
My goal is to find work and to achieve the level of English C1
(Mine is B1). For me, the quality of the work is important.
I think that specialist should follow the technologies. In my opinion, itâ€™s important to improve yourself and to not miss 
the opportunities as well as share your experience with other developers, but the only way to make all of these is to 
catch up the technologies.

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Skills
I use JS, HTML/CSS well. Also I have experience with Node.js, Angular, View.js and React.
I mainly use git when developing. I use BEM-methodology to write styles.
Also have some experience in programming in Java, C# and PHP. Know OOP well.
Sometimes I do some design for website, or working on freelance.

## Code examples
```javascript if (props) {
        Object.entries(props).forEach(([key, value]) => {
            if (key.startsWith('on') && typeof value === 'function') {
                element.addEventListener(key.substring(2), value);
            } else if (key.startsWith('data-')) {
                element.setAttribute(key, value);
            } else {
                element[key] = value;
            }
        });
